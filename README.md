# Don't use this.
I doubt it even works. I made this a long time ago when I was still a newbie and it includes some pretty bad code, it is all based on plain JS (still surprises me how I managed to pull this off). Use something like [Flam3rboy/discord-bot-client](https://github.com/Flam3rboy/discord-bot-client) instead.


# DiscordBotLogin
Log in asÂ a Discord Bot and get an UI View using bot's token!

## How to use
#### Requirements
1. NodeJS installed
2. electron installed (npm install -global electron)

#### Usage
1. Download the repository as a zip (or clone it)
2. Go into the directory and put bot's token into token.json
3. Open command prompt (terminal) in the same directory
4. Put npm start in the Terminal
5. Use the app!
